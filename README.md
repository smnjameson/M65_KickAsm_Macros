A 45gs02 syntax highlighting file for use in Sublime Text when using the Kick Assembler from KickC, and some macros to simplify some Mega65 operations. 

## Usage

```
	#import "m65macros.asm"
```
## Using the Kick Assembler found in KickC

In order to properly assemble 45gs02, you will need to use the Kick Assembler jar made by Jesper Gravgaard, found in KickC @

When assembling, make sure you run the Assembler file to invoke the correct class as follows:

java -cp kickass.jar kickass.KickAssembler65CE02  


## SublimeText Syntax File

Included in this repo is the KickAssembler (Mega65).sublime-syntax which can be dropped into the users package folder in sublime to provide syntax highlighting for all the commands. You can then go to view->syntax and select it from the drop down list for any given file.
